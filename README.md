# Simple-ML-Engineering-Project
Mini project to learn how to use MLFlow for productionizing ML models. 

It uses MLFlow to manage experimentation, model tracking and serving. 

Airflow is used to schedule the whole pipeline to enable retraining overtime as new data becomes available and to account for data distribution shifts.
